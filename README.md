# Description:
The goal of this project was to create a logo maker.  The user would be able to enter information about the logo, such as the shape, shape color, text, and text color.  Once the user is prompted with these questions and enters a response, the logo will be created in a logo.svg file.  

# Challenges:
There were many challenges that I faced while creating this project.  One of the challenges was understanding what a SVG is and understanding how to create SVG strings.  Once those things were solved, the project went smoothly from there on out.
